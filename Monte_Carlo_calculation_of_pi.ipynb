    "## Monte Carlo determination of $\\pi$\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that we have a circle of radius 1 ($r = 1$), centered at the point $(0, 0)$ in Cartesian coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can further imagine that circle being enclosed by a square with the same center and with sides of length $2r$, in this case 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Enclosed_circle.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a square with sides of length $2r$, the square's area is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A_{square} = (2r)^2 = 4r^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "whereas the area of a circle with radius $r$ is\n",
    "$$A_{circle} = \\pi r^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore the ratio of the area of the circle to that of the enclosing square is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{A_{circle}}{A_{square}} = \\frac{\\pi r^2}{4r^2} = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "By rearranging this expression, we see we can define $\\pi$ as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\pi = 4\\frac{A_{circle}}{A_{square}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**And *this* suggests a way to calculate $\\pi$!**\n",
    "\n",
    "If we're able to figure out the ratio of the areas of a circle and the smallest square that can hold that circle, we can figure out $\\pi$. And fortunately, this ratio is equal to the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the square also falls inside the circle. \n",
    "\n",
    "This means that we can calculate this ratio (and therefore $\\pi$) using a Monte Carlo simulation by choosing a large number of random points inside a square and tracking how many fall inside the circle.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pseudo-code\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the above, our algorithm for determining $\\pi$ looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For each of $N$ iterations,\n",
    "    1. Select a random point inside the square depicted above.\n",
    "    1. Determine if the point also falls inside the largest circle that can be enclosed within this square.\n",
    "    1. Keep track of whether or not this point fell inside the circle. At the end of $N$ iterations, you want to know $M$ -- the number of the $N$ random points that fell inside the circle!\n",
    "1. Calculate $\\pi$ as $4\\frac{M}{N}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: As you increase the value of $N$, you'll be able to estimate pi with greater accuracy!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function that calculates $\\pi$ using Julia.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to get started immediately, or to make use of the practice exercises below which have you solve pieces of the problem one at a time."
